Databases Talk 2014
==============

This repository contains code, and action items from an Intro To Databases talk covering the basics of MongoDB and it’s differences from SQL given on October 15, 2014.

## Code

Most of the boilerplate code was taken from a pervious talk: https://github.com/usacs/flaskTalkF2014
`cats.html` shows you how to write a simple static web page - something that looks like a Microsoft Word document.

`app.py` shows you how to do input/output on the web. It allows us to accept orders from customers, show them a "thanks for your order" page. The text messaging functionality was removed and instead, a history was added. 

1. Install [MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python app.py
4. go to localhost:5000 in a web browser

## Takeaways/Action Items

- Using databases to add persistence and storage to your application is fairly straightforward.
- There are many databases that you can use and they all have their advantages and disadvantages to each of them.

## Resources
- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) - MongoDB, the database that was covered during this talk
- [S.Q.L](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) - SQL stands for Structured Query Language here is some more information about it
- [Flask Docs](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - Flask docs. They're pretty well written with code examples, and well written explanations of concepts.
- [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) - Teaches you the basics of Python. Good for people new to programming.
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) - Interesting math-y problems that you can use for code practice in any language. I recommend picking up Python by doing the first ~10 problems if you've already taken 111/112.
- Google, StackOverflow, [Rutgers Hackathon Club](http://hackathonclub.com/)
